                        involves giving users the choice of paying a fee in order to view Content that YipTV would not
                        otherwise be able to make available without charging a fee. For that reason, we ask you to pay a
                        subscription fee to access the YipTV Content.

                        You can find the specific details regarding your subscription to YipTV at any time by logging in on
                        the YipTV website and clicking on Account next to your name. You agree that your YipTV account is
                        for individual use only and your YipTV account is limited to only one simultaneous stream at a time.
                        Additionally, you agree that for various reasons, such as restrictions from content licensors and
                        other limitations or considerations from third parties, certain Content that may be accessible
                        through one Property may not be accessible through other Properties.

                        Because the YipTV Service is offered in multiple time zones, for consistency, a "day" for purposes
                        of these Terms of Use begins at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time and ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time of that

                        in connection with your use of YipTV to the Payment Method. If you want to use a different Payment

                        subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last
                        day of such month. For example, if you became a paying subscriber on January 31, your Payment Method
                        would next be billed on February 28. If you change your Payment Method, this could result in
                        changing the calendar day upon which you are billed. You acknowledge that the amount billed each
                        Monthly Period may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your subscription plan, and changes in
                        applicable taxes, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the corresponding amounts.
                        If YipTV changes the subscription fee or other charges for YipTV from time to time, we will give you
                        advance notice of these changes by email. However, we will not be able to notify you of changes in

                        affected subscribers. The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at
                        YipTV's sole and absolute discretion, and the provision of credits in one instance does not entitle

                        American Arbitration Association using its Commercial Arbitration Rules. It's important to us that
                        we address any issues you might have promptly. To help us do that, you agree to begin any
                        arbitration within one year after your claim arose; otherwise, your claim is waived. As an exception
                        to this arbitration agreement, YipTV is happy to give you the right to pursue in small claims court
                        any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction as long as you proceed only on an individual
                        basis.</span>

                    <span translate="TERMS_OF_USE_TERM13_DESCRIPTION3">
                        Because we prefer to resolve our issues with you directly, you agree to arbitrate with YipTV only in
                        your individual capacity, not as a representative or member of a class. As such, your claims may not
                        be joined with any other claims and there shall be no authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on
                        a class-action basis or brought by a purported class representative.</span>

                        Rather than force everyone to visit us in Florida, if you can demonstrate that arbitration in
                        Florida would create an undue burden to you, you are free to initiate the arbitration in your home
                        state. Otherwise, the arbitration hearings will be held in West Palm Beach, Florida.</span>

                        It is important that you understand that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and may be
                        entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator rules against YipTV,
                        in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the arbitrator, we think it's fair
                        that YipTV reimburse your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</span>

                        for at least 30 days. To do that, please send your full name and contact information, your concern
