                    <span class="about-text">Embedding </span>a Video Using the Video Player. Where YipTV has
                    incorporated an embed option in connection with Content on the YipTV Services, you may embed videos

                    regulation, infringes any right of any third party including intellectual property rights, or is
                    otherwise inappropriate or objectionable to YipTV (in YipTV's sole discretion), or (ii) links to
                    infringing or unauthorized content (collectively, "Unsuitable Material"). You may not embed the
                    Video Player into any hardware or software application, even for non-commercial purposes. YipTV
                    reserves the right to prevent embedding to any website or other location that YipTV finds
                    inappropriate or objectionable (as determined by YipTV in its sole discretion).

                    If YipTV determines in its sole discretion that you are violating any of these Terms, we may (i)
                    notify you, and (ii) use technical measures to block or restrict your access or use of the YipTV

                    <span class="about-text">No Spam/Unsolicited Communications.</span> We know how annoying and
                    upsetting it can be to receive unwanted email or instant messages from people you do not know.
                    Therefore, no one may use the YipTV Services to harvest information about users for the purpose of
                    sending, or to facilitate or encourage the sending of, unsolicited bulk or other communications. You
                    understand that we may take any technical remedies to prevent spam or unsolicited bulk or other
                    communications from entering, utilizing, or remaining within our computer or communications
                    networks. If you Post (as defined below in Section 7) or otherwise send spam, advertising, or other
                    unsolicited communications of any kind through the YipTV Services, you acknowledge that you will
                    have caused substantial harm to YipTV and that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult
                    to measure. As a reasonable estimation of such harm, you agree to pay YipTV $150 for each such
                    unsolicited communication you send through the YipTV Services.

                    access certain Content, you may be notified that it is necessary to download software or other
                    materials or agree to additional terms and conditions. Unless otherwise provided by these additional
                    terms and conditions, they are hereby incorporated into these Terms.

                    suspend, or discontinue - temporarily or permanently - some or all of the YipTV Services (including
                    the Content and the devices through which the YipTV Services are accessed), with respect to any or
                    all users, at any time without notice. You acknowledge that YipTV may do so in YipTV's sole

                    discontinuance of the YipTV Services, although if you are a YipTV subscriber and YipTV suspends or
                    discontinues the YipTV service, YipTV may, in its sole discretion, provide you with a credit,
                    refund, discount or other form of consideration (for example, we may credit additional days of
                    service to your account) in accordance with Section 4 below. However, if YipTV terminates your
                    account or suspends or discontinues your access to YipTV Services due to your violation of these
                    Terms, then you will not be eligible for any such credit, refund, discount or other consideration.

                    <br><br>
                    While it is our mission to provide users with as many viewing choices as possible, sometimes that
                    involves giving users the choice of paying a fee in order to view Content that YipTV would not
                    otherwise be able to make available without charging a fee. For that reason, we ask you to pay a
                    subscription fee to access the YipTV Content.

                    You can find the specific details regarding your subscription to YipTV at any time by logging in on

                    for individual use only and your YipTV account is limited to only one simultaneous stream at a time.
                    Additionally, you agree that for various reasons, such as restrictions from content licensors and

                    Because the YipTV Service is offered in multiple time zones, for consistency, a "day" for purposes
                    of these Terms of Use begins at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time and ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time of that

                    <span class="about-text">Billing.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    By providing a credit card or other payment method accepted by YipTV (“Payment Method”) for your
                    YipTV subscription, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you a monthly
                    subscription fee, any other fees for additional services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes
                    in connection with your use of YipTV to the Payment Method. If you want to use a different Payment
                    Method than the one you signed up for during registration, or if there is a change in your credit
                    card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information by logging in on the
                    YipTV website and clicking on clicking on Account next to your name. If your Payment Method expires
                    and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account, you authorize us to
                    continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
                    <br><br>
                    As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable,
                    against your Payment Method. The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your
                    subscription or expiration of your free trial period, if any, whichever is earlier, and on each
                    monthly renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account or service
                    is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these Terms. To see the commencement date for
                    your next renewal period, log in on the YipTV website and click on clicking on Account next to your
                    name.
                    <br><br>
                    We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the
                    commencement of your subscription (each such month, a “Monthly Period”). In the event your
                    subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last
                    day of such month. For example, if you became a paying subscriber on January 31, your Payment Method
                    would next be billed on February 28. If you change your Payment Method, this could result in
                    changing the calendar day upon which you are billed. You acknowledge that the amount billed each
                    Monthly Period may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your subscription plan, and changes in
                    applicable taxes, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the corresponding amounts.
                    If YipTV changes the subscription fee or other charges for YipTV from time to time, we will give you
                    advance notice of these changes by email. However, we will not be able to notify you of changes in
                    any applicable taxes.
                    <br><br>
                    Very rarely, if there are special circumstances where YipTV determines it is appropriate (e.g., the
                    YipTV service is unavailable for days due to technical difficulties), we may provide credits to
                    affected subscribers. The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at
                    YipTV's sole and absolute discretion, and the provision of credits in one instance does not entitle
                    anyone to credits in the future under similar or different circumstances.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span class="about-text">Ongoing Subscription and Cancellation.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Your YipTV subscription will continue in effect on a month-to-month basis unless and until you
                    cancel your subscription or the account or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant
                    to these Terms. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each Monthly Period in order to
                    avoid the next billing. We will bill the monthly subscription fee plus any applicable taxes to the
                    Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change
                    your account information). If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the
                    end of the current Monthly Period -this means that you will have continued access to YipTV for the
                    remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund. You can cancel your account by logging
                    in on the YipTV website and clicking on clicking on Account next to your name and then choosing to
                    "edit" your subscription under "Billing Information" and clicking on the "cancel" option.

                    <span class="about-text">Unpaid Amounts.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    In order to sustain the YipTV service, it is important that each user of the YipTV service honor the
                    payment obligations to which the user agreed. Accordingly, we reserve the right to pursue any
                    amounts you fail to pay in connection with YipTV. You will remain liable to YipTV for all such
                    amounts and all costs we incur in connection with the collection of these amounts, including,
                    without limitation, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, and arbitration or court
                    costs.

                    <span class="about-text">Free or Beta Trials.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    On occasion, we may be authorized to offer the use of YipTV through free trials for certain
                    qualifying users. If we offer you a free trial, the specific terms of your free trial will be stated
                    in the marketing material describing the particular free trial. We are unable to accommodate
                    combining free trials with any other offers. To view the specific details regarding your free trial,
                    if any, log in on the YipTV website and access your account.
                    <br><br>
                    Once your free or beta trial period ends, we will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly
                    subscription fees corresponding to your subscription plan (plus any applicable taxes), unless you
                    cancel prior to the end of your free trial. For that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free
                    trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid Payment Method when redeeming a free or beta
                    trial offer.
                    <br><br><br>
                    It is very important to understand that you will not receive a notice from YipTV that your free
                    trial subscription has ended or that your paying subscription has begun.<span class="about-text">If you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Method, you must cancel YipTV prior to midnight Eastern Time on the last day of your free trial period. </span>You
                    can cancel your account by logging in on the YipTV website and accessing your clicking on Account

                    monthly basis for your subscription plan until you cancel or the account or service is otherwise
                    suspended or discontinued pursuant to these Terms. You may cancel your subscription at any time as
                    described in the Ongoing Subscription and Cancellation section of these Terms. To the extent YipTV
                    subscriptions are offered in conjunction with purchases of, or payment for, third party products or
                    services, you agree that YipTV will not be liable to you for any claims arising out of or related to
                    your purchase or use of such third party products or services.

                    <br><br>
                    It is YipTV's policy not to accept unsolicited submissions, including scripts, story lines,
                    articles, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, ideas, or concepts. YipTV's
                    policy is to delete any such submission without reading it. Therefore, any similarity between an

                    title, or concept, would be purely coincidental.

                    <br><br>
                    <span
                        class="about-name">PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. WE WANT YOU TO KNOW IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    At YipTV, we expect that our world-class customer service team will be able to resolve most issues
                    you may have using the YipTV Services. In the unlikely event that we do not meet your satisfaction,
                    we prefer to specify now what each of us should expect in order to avoid any confusion later.
                    Accordingly, you and YipTV agree to the following resolution process.
                    <br><br>
                    To begin with, you agree that that any claim that you might have against us regarding these Terms of
                    Use, the YipTV Services, or the Properties must be resolved through binding arbitration before the
                    American Arbitration Association using its Commercial Arbitration Rules. It's important to us that
                    we address any issues you might have promptly. To help us do that, you agree to begin any
                    arbitration within one year after your claim arose; otherwise, your claim is waived. As an exception
                    to this arbitration agreement, YipTV is happy to give you the right to pursue in small claims court
                    any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction as long as you proceed only on an individual
                    basis.
                    <br><br>
                    Because we prefer to resolve our issues with you directly, you agree to arbitrate with YipTV only in
                    your individual capacity, not as a representative or member of a class. As such, your claims may not
                    be joined with any other claims and there shall be no authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on
                    a class-action basis or brought by a purported class representative.
                    <br><br>
                    Rather than force everyone to visit us in Florida, if you can demonstrate that arbitration in
                    Florida would create an undue burden to you, you are free to initiate the arbitration in your home
                    state. Otherwise, the arbitration hearings will be held in West Palm Beach, Florida.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important that you understand that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and may be
                    entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator rules against YipTV,
                    in addition to accepting whatever responsibility is ordered by the arbitrator, we think it's fair
                    that YipTV reimburse your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
                    <br><br>
                    If you're not sure what all of this means, of course please feel free to ask an attorney.
                    <br><br>
                    Since we always prefer to find ways to satisfy you as quickly and efficiently as possible, before
                    initiating any arbitration proceeding, you agree to first discuss the matter informally with YipTV
                    for at least 30 days. To do that, please send your full name and contact information, your concern
                    and your proposed solution by mail to us at: YipTV, Inc., 222 Lakeview Ave, Ste 160-186, West Palm
                    Beach, FL 33401 - Attn: Legal Department.
                    <br><br>
                    Specifying what happens if an issue arises with one of our users is never a fun topic. But we pride
                    ourselves on transparency and we thank you in advance for understanding why it’s important that you
                    and YipTV agree on the process described in this Section.

                    <span class="about-text">Choice of Law and Forum.</span> These Terms of Use are governed by, and
                    construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to principles
                    of conflicts of law. In the event of a claim by you against YipTV, you agree to submit to the
                    exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Los Angeles County of the State of Florida. In
                    the event of a claim by YipTV against you, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts
                    located where YipTV pursues its claim against you, which may include courts in the Los Angeles
                    County of the State of Florida.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="about-text">No Waiver/Reliance.</span> If you see other parties violating these Terms,
                    we would appreciate it if you would let us know at feedback@yiptv.com (subject line: "TOU
                    Violation"). Precisely how YipTV responds to a party that is violating these Terms will be
                    determined after carefully analyzing all of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. You
                    may not rely upon YipTV's precise response with respect to one party or one situation as any
                    indication of what YipTV might do with respect to another party or another situation, even if the
                    parties or situations appear to you to be similar. Similarly, if we fail to act in response to a
                    violation of these Terms of Use, you should not assume that we do not object to the violation or
                    even that we are aware of it. In addition, you may not construe a waiver of any provision of these
                    Terms of Use with respect to any party as a waiver of that provision (or any other provision) with
                    respect to either that party or any other party. Further, YipTV's decision to delay exercising or
                    enforcing any right or remedy under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right
                    or remedy. Even if YipTV acts in a way that appears to you to be inconsistent with these Terms of
                    Use, YipTV's action shall not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of these Terms.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="about-text">Integration, Amendment, and Severability.</span> Please note that these
                    Terms of Use, including YipTV's Privacy Policy which is incorporated in these Terms and any end user
                    license agreement that might accompany YipTV authorized applications, features and devices,
                    constitute the entire legal agreement between you and YipTV and govern your use of the YipTV
                    Services (including your use of the Content) (but excludes any services, if any, that YipTV may
                    provide to you under a separate signed written agreement), and completely replaces any prior
                    agreements between you and YipTV in relation to the YipTV Services. Except as set forth in Section 2
                    above, these Terms may not be amended or varied except in a writing signed by YipTV. Although we
                    understand that electronic or digital signatures are frequently viewed as the equivalent of
                    traditional written signatures these days, for these purposes, a signature or "signed" writing or
                    written agreement may not include an electronic or digital signature. These Terms of Use operate to
                    the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void,
                    or unenforceable, you and we agree that the provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and
                    will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you for taking the time to read these Terms of Use. By understanding and agreeing to follow
                    these Terms, the experience will be better for all users. Enjoy experiencing the YipTV Services!
