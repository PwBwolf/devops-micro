                    </li><li>Other Parties When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your Rights or Ours.

If you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by YipTV or another user of the YipTV Services, we may provide the information that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint.

                    In addition to the specific data sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy, we may also share the information collected from or about you for other purposes in aggregated or non-personally identifiable forms. This means that we will combine information about individuals together, or otherwise anonymize the information, so that no individual person is identifiable.

For example, we may share aggregate information with advertisers about the volume of use on the YipTV Services, the specific YipTV videos in which users are most interested, and the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the YipTV Services (including the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement). Also, we and our business partners use independent third parties to help measure viewing of content on YipTV, and these third parties may report statistics about viewing in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.

                    <span class="about-name">How does YipTV protect the information it collects from or about me?</span><br>

                    We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. For example, passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted in transit. We also take steps to ensure that only those YipTV employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your information are granted access.

                    <br>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information on our order forms), we encrypt that information using secure sockets layer technology (SSL), an industry standard protocol for billing transmission in order to help protect the financial information you send us.

                    <br>Despite these efforts, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using the YipTV Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Please refer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

                    <br>
                    We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the YipTV Services and the Internet. This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.
                    <br>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser. Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform. For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited. They enable us to make your use of the YipTV Services more enjoyable.

Cookies are one way that this kind of information is stored.
                                </li><li>We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use cookies and similar technologies to compile aggregate data about you and to relate your use of the YipTV Services to information obtained from you or from reputable third parties. For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the YipTV Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you.
                            </li><li>You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain YipTV Services.
                            </li><li>Some advertisements displayed in connection with the YipTV Services may also access or place cookies on your Internet browser or use other technologies provided by third-party Internet advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services.

Sometimes called "browser cookies," these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings.

                    </li><li>Web beacons. We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use technologies that communicate information from your Internet browser or the YipTV video player to a web server, including so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags"). Pixel Tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed. Pixel Tags are used to improve your YipTV experience, including to provide you with content, including advertisements, customized to your interests.
