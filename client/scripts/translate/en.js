Except as set forth in Section 2 above, these Terms may not be amended or varied except in a writing signed by YipTV.

These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, you and we agree that the provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.',
