            LEADERSHIP_BA7_DESCRIPTION: 'Oscar Nominated Director Bryan Buckley has been dubbed the \'King of the Super Bowl\' by the New York Times. Directing over 50 commercials for the big game since 2000. Many pieces of Buckley’s work have been inducted into the Museum Of Modern Art’s permanent collection and he is an esteemed recipient of the DGA award, Emmy’s and over 50 Cannes Lions. A 2010 Adweek Readers Poll named Buckley the Commercial Director of the decade and he was also chosen as one of the 50 best Creative Minds in the last 25 years by Creativity Magazine. Buckley\'s directing career started in 1994 when he directed the Emmy Award winning \'This is SportsCenter\' Campaign. In 1997, Buckley co-found Hungryman along with \'This is SportsCenter\' creator, Hank Perlman. By 2004, the company won the Cannes Festival\'s Palme D\'or as the top commercial production company in the world and has finished in the top ten for more than ten consecutive years, the first production company to do so. Buckley wrote and directed the short film ASAD. The film was shot in Africa with an all Somali, refugee cast and screened at over 50 film festivals worldwide, taking top honors at the TriBeCa Film Festival, Austin Film Festival, Florida Film Festival and Michael Moore\'s Traverse City Film Festival, to name a few. In 2013, Buckley was nominated for an Academy Award for ASAD. Buckley\'s first feature film, The Bronze, opened the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The film stars The Big Bang Theory\'s Melissa Rauch as a foul-mouthed former gymnastics bronze medalist who must fight for her local celebrity status when a new young athlete\'s star rises in town. In 2015 Buckley will direct Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, starring Reese Witherspoon. The film will be an adaptation of Dr. John Gray\'s book, which has sold more copies than any other non-fiction book other than the Bible and Koran.',
